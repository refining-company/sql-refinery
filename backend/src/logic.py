SQL Refining â€” Backend Component (Stage 1c: Workspace & Logic Analysis)

Architecture Overview:
1. Backend pipeline:
   a) SQL parsing (sql.py)
   b) Code AST abstraction (code.py)
   c) Workspace & logic analysis (workspace.py, logic.py)
2. LSP server (server.py) transforms pipeline outputs into LSP diagnostics and code lenses
3. VS Code frontend (frontend-vscode) visualizes and interacts with LSP features

This module provides:
- `Variation`, representing groups of similar expressions with similarity and reliability
- `compare()`, which finds expressions with potentially flawed or duplicated business logic

Analysis description:
- Find expressions that look similar but not exact; likely variations of the same business logic
- Drives diagnostics for variations such as:
    ```sql
    IF revenue > 3000 THEN ... as priority
    ```
    vs
    ```sql
    IF revenue > 2500 THEN ... as priority
    ```
