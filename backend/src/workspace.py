Pipeline â€” Workspace & Logic Analysis

Architecture:
- Pipeline: SQL parsing, Code AST abstraction, Workspace & Logic Analysis (this module)
- Server: LSP server (server.py) - thin I/O wrapper
- Frontend: VS Code extension (frontend-vscode)

This module provides:
- `Workspace` singleton as process manager and data hub
- Rebuilds analysis from scratch on every file operation
- Caches all computed results in `output` for server to send
