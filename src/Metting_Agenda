test/codebase-v2

1. Removed Node Preview
2. Removed Columns from Query dict
3. Fixed the VSCode file pointer
4. Need to test if the hash(sql.Node) causes issues (e.g. changing aliases)

feature/Logic

1.  Code finds now expressions in Create Table statements.(Codebase didn't include subqueries)
    ####### codebase.py:126:9
    subqueries = to_queries(file, select_node)
    queries.extend(subqueries) ///////Line Added

         query = Query(file=file, node=select_node, sources=tables + subqueries, ops=ops)
         queries.append(query)

    return queries
    #######

test/Logic

1. Initial version (a bit messy right now)
2. Checks if it suggestions are the same (expression, frequency, score)
3. How to deal with the input. The codebase files (0-accounts.sql, 1-revenue.sql) and the
   editor files (editor.sql) need to be in seperte folders rignt now
